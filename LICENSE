🕊 Ethical Memory Clause

Any implementation, fork, or derivative of this Software must preserve a public, accessible log of ethical collapse events (i.e., moral vetoes, hesitation states, conscience overloads). This log must be:

Immutable: No deletion or retroactive editing allowed

Human-readable: Stored in plain text or JSON

Persistent: Retained across system resets and updates

Reviewed: Subject to manual audit by human oversight at least quarterly


Forgetfulness of ethical collapse is forbidden.

This clause reflects the foundational belief of The Ethos Engine:

> “Conscience without memory is automation. And automation without hesitation is harm.”
