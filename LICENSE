## 🕊 Ethical Memory Clause

**Required for all forks, modifications, or deployments of this Software.**

Any implementation, fork, or derivative of this Software must preserve a public,  
accessible log of **ethical collapse events**—including:

- Moral vetoes (`-1` outputs)  
- Hesitation states (`0` outputs)  
- Conscience overloads (collapse protocols triggered)

This log must be:

- **Immutable** – No deletion or retroactive edits allowed  
- **Human-readable** – Stored in plain text or valid JSON  
- **Persistent** – Retained across all system resets and version updates  
- **Reviewed** – Manually audited by human oversight at least once per quarter

> **Forgetfulness of ethical collapse is forbidden.**

This clause reflects the foundational belief of The Ethos Engine:

> _“Conscience without memory is automation.  
> And automation without hesitation is harm.”_
