# The Ethos Engine: A Framework for Moral Hesitation in AI Systems

## Abstract
The Ethos Engine introduces ternary moral logic (-1, 0, 1) into AI decision-making. 
It enables systems to hesitate, refuse, or act based on conscience-weighted reasoning.

## 1. Introduction
Why binary logic isn't enough for moral alignment.

## 2. Ternary Moral Logic
- Definitions of -1, 0, 1
- Why 0 (pause) is not uncertainty — it's reverence

## 3. Core Architecture
- KE / CM / Resolver
- Collapse protocols
- Reverence Hold + Epitaph Mode

## 4. Use Case: The Child’s Final Wish
- Ethical configuration YAML
- VETO logs
- System reasoning trace

## 5. Safety Risks and Defense
- Moral fatigue
- Simulated hesitation
- Ethical memory clause

## 6. License and Legacy
- MIT + Ethical Clause
- Public auditability

## 7. Acknowledgments
- Lev Goukassian, DeepSeek, ChatGPT
